when selecting account and going to last page of the grid eg. page 4
enter search term that brings back no records and do a browser refresh
- the grid will show with no records but the page number
  input box at the bottom will be out of sync
- for example if the total number of pages is 3 after the search,
  the page input box at bottom will show 4 because this is the
  value of the page input box when stored in the session on unload
  and repopulated from the session on load of form


on reload when repopulating the form records values from the session
compare the form_pageNumber session value with the number of pages
of the search
- need to create an new ajax function: getTotalPageNumber
  that brings back the total page number of the search
- after the call returns then compare the form_pageNumber with
  the value returned by getTotalPageNumber
- if the value of form_pageNumber is greater than getTotalPageNumber
  then set the page number to 1 before painting the grid on reload_values function
- otherwise if form_pageNumber is less than or equal to getTotalPageNumber
  then continue
