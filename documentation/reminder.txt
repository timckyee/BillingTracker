please note that using getXmlHttpRequest is asynchronous
so that any call after this ajax call possibly may never be called

note: need to put the call after the ajax call in the response

window.getXmlHttpRequest.onreadystatechange 

if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {

    var response = JSON.parse(this.responseText);

    //code should go here
    
}
